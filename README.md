# artecshpp

**artecshpp** is an entity component system for games based on [EntityX](https://github.com/alecthomas/entityx) and [Artemis](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb), but surely worse than those. The aim is to explore strategies on implementing an ECS, but **NOT** to be a ready-to-use ECS.
